A stiff body structure, a responsive steering system and an integrated KONI frequency selective damping front and rear strut system all add up to premium performance. The Renegade combines iconic Jeep styling with a smaller city friendly package. The available My Sky open-air, dual-panel roof features panels that can simply be retracted or removed completely for true open-air driving. Wheel options range from 16 to 18 inch. Renegade offers a host of over 70 active and passive safety and security features as well. The Renegade is available with two 4x4 systems: Jeep Active Drive on Sport, Latitude and Limited models and Jeep Active Drive Low on Trailhawk models. Both systems feature a rear axle disconnect system that seamlessly switches between two and four-wheel drive. The system increases efficiency when 4x4 isn’t needed and enhances traction when it is. Every Renegade 4x4 is equipped with available Selec-Terrain traction control. The system allows the driver to tune traction settings for conditions such as snow, sand, mud and exclusive to the Trailhawk model an additional rock setting. The Renegade gives you a choice of two powerful, fuel efficient engines including a 160hp 1.4L MultiAir Turbo Engine with 6-speed manual transmission standard to the Sport and Latitude models or a 180hp 2.4L Tigershark Engine with a 9-speed automatic transmission standard on Limited and Trailhawk models. Inside you will be greeted by such features as the Uconnect systems that come with options such as bluetooth, back up camera, and GPS. Other available features include USB/Aux input, heated seats and steering wheel, and an available nine speaker 506-watt audio system.* Stop By Today *Stop by SKCO Automotive located at 7410 Airport Blvd, Mobile, AL 36608 for a quick visit and a great vehicle!","BLACK  CLOTH LOW-BACK BUCKET SEATS,QUICK ORDER PACKAGE 27A  -inc: Engine: 2.4L I4 MultiAir  Transmission: 9-Speed 948TE Automatic,WHEELS: 16 X 6.5 STYLED STEEL  (STD),COLORADO RED,TRANSMISSION: 9-SPEED 948TE AUTOMATIC  -inc: Vinyl Shift Knob,3.734 AXLE RATIO,ENGINE: 2.4L I4 MULTIAIR  -inc: Flex Fuel Vehicle  3.734 Axle Ratio  Engine Oil Cooler,POWER & AIR GROUP  -inc: Air Conditioning  Speed Control  Power Heated Mirrors,Front Wheel Drive,Power Steering,ABS,4-Wheel Disc Brakes,Brake Assist,Steel Wheels,Tires - Front All-Season,Tires - Rear All-Season,Rear Defrost,Intermittent Wipers,Variable Speed Intermittent Wipers,Rear Spoiler,Power Door Locks,Daytime Running Lights,AM/FM Stereo,MP3 Player,Steering Wheel Audio Controls,Auxiliary Audio Input,Pass-Through Rear Seat,Rear Bench Seat,Adjustable Steering Wheel,Trip Computer,Power Windows,Keyless Entry,Power Door Locks,Cloth Seats,Bucket Seats,Driver Vanity Mirror,Passenger Vanity Mirror,Power Windows,Power Door Locks,Trip Computer,Immobilizer,Traction Control,Stability Control,Traction Control,Front Side Air Bag,Tire Pressure Monitor,Driver Air Bag,Passenger Air Bag,Front Head Air Bag,Rear Head Air Bag,Passenger Air Bag Sensor,Knee Air Bag,Child Safety Locks","Exterior@Aero-Composite Halogen Daytime Running Headlamps w/Delay-Off~Exterior@Black Bodyside Cladding and Black Wheel Well Trim~Exterior@Black Door Handles~Exterior@Black Front Bumper~Exterior@Black Grille w/Chrome Accents~Exterior@Black Manual Side Mirrors w/Manual Folding~Exterior@Black Rear Step Bumper w/Metal-Look Rub Strip/Fascia Accent~Exterior@Black Side Windows Trim~Exterior@Fixed Rear Window w/Fixed Interval Wiper and Defroster~Exterior@Front License Plate Bracket~Exterior@Fully Galvanized Steel Panels~Exterior@Liftgate Rear Cargo Access~Exterior@Light Tinted Glass~Exterior@Lip Spoiler~Exterior@Perimeter/Approach Lights~Exterior@Tailgate/Rear Door Lock Included w/Power Door Locks~Exterior@Tire mobility kit~Exterior@Tires: P215/65R16 LBL AS~Exterior@Variable Intermittent Wipers~Exterior@Wheels: 16 x 6.5 Styled Steel~Interior@1 LCD Monitor In The Front~Interior@2 12V DC Power Outlets~Interior@4 Speakers~Interior@4-Way Passenger Seat -inc: Manual Recline, Fore/Aft Movement and Fold Flat~Interior@6-Way Driver Seat -inc: Manual Recline, Height Adjustment and Fore/Aft Movement~Interior@60-40 Folding Split-Bench Front Facing Fold Forward Seatback Cloth Rear Seat~Interior@Air Filtration~Interior@Cargo Area Concealed Storage~Interior@Cargo Features -inc: Tire Mobility Kit~Interior@Cargo Space Lights~Interior@Carpet Floor Trim~Interior@Cloth Door Trim Insert~Interior@Cloth Low-Back Bucket Seats~Interior@Compass~Interior@Day-Night Rearview Mirror~Interior@Delayed Accessory Power~Interior@Digital/Analog Appearance~Interior@Driver And Passenger Door Bins~Interior@Driver And Passenger Visor Vanity Mirrors~Interior@Driver Foot Rest~Interior@Driver Information Center~Interior@Fade-To-Off Interior Lighting~Interior@Front And Rear Map Lights~Interior@Front Cupholder~Interior@Full Carpet Floor Covering~Interior@Full Cloth Headliner~Interior@Full Floor Console w/Covered Storage, Mini Overhead Console w/Storage and 2 12V DC Power Outlets~Interior@Gauges -inc: Speedometer, Odometer, Voltmeter, Engine Coolant Temp, Tachometer, Oil Temperature, Transmission Fluid Temp, Trip Odometer and Trip Computer~Interior@HVAC -inc: Underseat Ducts~Interior@Illuminated Locking Glove Box~Interior@Integrated Roof Antenna~Interior@Interior Trim -inc: Colored Instrument Panel Insert, Colored Door Panel Insert, Colored Console Insert and Metal-Look Interior Accents~Interior@Manual Anti-Whiplash Adjustable Front Head Restraints and Manual Adjustable Rear Head Restraints~Interior@Manual Tilt/Telescoping Steering Column~Interior@Metal-Look Gear Shifter Material~Interior@Outside Temp Gauge~Interior@Power 1st Row Windows w/Driver And Passenger 1-Touch Up/Down~Interior@Power Door Locks w/Autolock Feature~Interior@Power Rear Windows and Fixed 3rd Row Windows~Interior@Radio w/Seek-Scan, Clock, Speed Compensated Volume Control, Aux Audio Input Jack, Steering Wheel Controls, Radio Data System and External Memory Control~Interior@Radio: Uconnect 3.0 AM/FM~Interior@Rear Cupholder~Interior@Redundant Digital Speedometer~Interior@Remote Keyless Entry w/Integrated Key Transmitter, Illuminated Entry and Panic Button~Interior@Remote Releases -Inc: Power Fuel~Interior@Seats w/Cloth Back Material~Interior@Sentry Key Immobilizer~Interior@Sliding Front Center Armrest~Interior@Trip Computer~Interior@Valet Function~Mechanical@12.7 Gal.

Showgoers only had one request: Build it. The CLA has brought an international sensation to fruition with nothing lost in translation, from its diamond-block grille to its frameless door glass to its sweeping taillamps. Its coefficient of drag is among the lowest not just in its class but the entire industry, cutting fuel consumption and wind noise. Beyond its incredibly low drag, export airflow management enhances roadholding, stability and even poor-weather visibility. The price leadership of the CLA takes nothing away from every other aspect of leadership that comes with the Three-Pointed Star. From the winglike dash and tablet-style color screen, to its high-back power front sport seats with memory, to its available Panorama glass roof and multimedia systems, it's a cabin that puts you ahead of the crowd. Under the hood of the CLA is a new era of performance. With two options, a 208hp 2.0L turbo engine or 355hp 2.0L exclusively in the CLA-45 with a 0-60 of 4.4 secs. A tablet style central screen teams with the elegant central controller to put a world of entertainment and navigation options within easy reach and clear view. Audio and entertainment features start with standard Bluetooth hands free calling and audio streaming, plus a USB port and HD Radio. Options range from a Media Interface for your iPod to SiriusXM Radio to harman/kardon surround sound, as well as a clever accessory to integrate entertainment, navigation and social media apps on your iPhone. Navigation options include the 80GB hard-drive-based COMAND system or an integrated plug in accessory. Both feature advanced voice control.* Stop By Today *A short visit to SKCO Automotive located at 7410 Airport Blvd, Mobile, AL 36608 can get you a trustworthy CLA-Class today!","Turbocharged,Front

The FWD gets an EPA estimated 18 MPG City and 25 MPG hwy, and the AWD gets 16 MPG City and 23 MPG hwy. Depending on Trim, the Sienna can hold 7-8 people as a two-wheel drive, and 7 if you get all-wheel drive. Based on seating configurations and how many people are in the vehicle, cargo room in the Sienna varies from over 39 cubic feet up to 150 cubic feet. The base L Trim comes generously appointed with items like Dual Sliding Side Doors, a 60/40 Split and Stow 3rd Row seat, Three-zone air conditioning, and Cruise control. Based on which you select, the higher trims can offer possibilities like a Sport mesh front grille, Power lift gate, and Perforated leather-trimmed seats.
