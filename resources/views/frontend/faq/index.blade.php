                      <div class="accordion-content">
                         <p>Localcarz is an information and technology platform that enables its users to communicate with Localcarz Certified Dealers for a great car buying experience. Our mission is simple: make the car buying process simple, fair and fun. Achieving this goal begins with us analyzing the most accurate, timely and comprehensive pricing information available and then making it easy to understand and available to all; free of charge. This kind of pricing information, which has only recently become available, will allow you to recognize a fair price based on what others actually paid. The result: consumers and dealers now have a guide that helps them establish a baseline of trust and agree on the parameters of a fair deal.

                      <div class="accordion-content">
                         <p>On the Localcarz Price Report, we show you what you can expect to pay on average for new cars in your area, based on what other people actually paid for their cars. We do all this so youâ€™ll be confident in your car purchase. Harness the power of this information, recognize a fair deal and essentially become a car buying expert.</p>

                      <div class="accordion-content">
                         <p>Dealers generally will do their best to match the vehicle you have configured on Localcarz, but many times they will not have an exact match for the car you are looking to purchase. This is not the dealer's fault, but rather a challenge with the way cars and trucks are manufactured and marketed. While some vehicles are produced in large numbers, other vehicles are produced in smaller numbers. To further complicate things, many options or colors will be produced in even more limited combinations. This creates a great deal of confusion for buyers that want a very specific configuration. Ultimately this can affect your expectations when contacting a dealer, so it may be helpful to keep an open mind about what the dealer may be offering as an alternative.</p>
